# Accessibility and assisted digital

All government services must be accessible to anyone that needs them. That means that all GOV.UK Verify identity providers must make sure their services:

- meet level AA of the most recent [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](LINK) as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used [assistive technologies](LINK) - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in [user research](LINK)

The [Service Manual guidance on accessibility and assisted digital](LINK) has best practice advice on how to help and encourage people to use your service.
This [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 ‘getting started’ guidance](LINK) also has:

- an easy to understand [overview of WCAG](LINK)
- [more details about each requirement](LINK) - including an understandable explanation of each success criteria, a pragmatic summary of what is required, example of common issues and links to further content
- the most relevant success criteria for [content](LINK), [design](LINK) and [code](LINK)
- a [checklist of questions](LINK) to help you assess if your digital product meets WCAG
