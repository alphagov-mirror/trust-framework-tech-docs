# Guidance for building or adapting a service for the trust framework

This guidance is for organisations that want to become providers on the trust framework. It will help you meet the standards when designing parts of the identity verification journey.

[Find out more about joining and participating in the trust framework](https://verify-participants-joining.herokuapp.com/drxik/join)

## What you have to do

When you get certified, your user journeys will be assessed against how they meet:

* the identity principles
* any required design patterns set out in the technical guidelines

You may be asked for evidence to show you meet the principles or why you may have deviated from any required design patterns. Evidence could take the form of user research documentation or journey maps.

You are expected to follow design patterns for:

* branding and trustmarks
* introducing digital identity
* giving users choice
* sign in pickers
* consent
