# User research

The [Service Manual guidance on user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research) has best practice advice on how to:

- plan research
- prepare for sessions
- share and analyse findings

These are our other recommendations for GOV.UK Verify-specific research.

## General

If your organisation does not have an in-house user research team or staff, work with a specialist user research agency to do research and testing. This should help to avoid delays that can happen if you haven’t done enough - or the right - research.

Read about [how to get the best out of research agencies](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/18/how-to-get-the-best-out-of-research-agencies/).

If you do have in-house user research experts, explain how their research is being integrated into the work of the rest of the team - you should do this as part of your [3-monthly reports](/3-monthly-report).

## Methodology

For each round of research you do, choose a research methodology suitable for the change you want to test, such as [usability testing or A/B testing.](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/user-research-in-live)

Consider what is appropriate for the type and size of the change you are making. Are you changing a button label? Adding a new sentence? Changing the flow of the journey? Use the list of user research methods in the Service Manual to help decide on the best approach.

## Representative participants

### Familiarity with the service

Research participants should not be familiar with the service. This is because most users of GOV.UK Verify will not have used it before. Testing with these participants will help you learn the most about real users’ behaviour.

The only exception is if you are testing re­use and signing into an existing account. Here it may be appropriate to have participants who have used the system before, but only to the extent that a real user would have.

### Digital confidence

Participants should have a realistic range of digital confidence. Everyone in the UK needs to be able to use government services. Many of them choose not to use the internet heavily in the rest of their lives. Testing with these participants will help you learn how these people understand and use your service.

One third of participants should have low digital confidence. Digital confidence can be best determined by asking potential participants what kinds of tasks they use the internet for (not by asking them to describe their confidence level). Tasks like online banking, booking travel and shopping indicate medium or high digital confidence. Use of social media alone does not indicate medium or high digital confidence.

### Range of devices and browsers

Do research with a range of devices and software that reflects the range that will be used to access your service. Not only will this allow your participants to test your service using technology that will be familiar to them, but it will also help expose any device or browser related issues with the service.

This should include:

- mobiles and tablets (both iOS and Android)
- computers (Windows and macOS)
- a variety of browsers (such as Chrome, Safari and Firefox)

Read the Service Manual guidance on [designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices).

### Users with disabilities

When doing research, include users who have disabilities (visual, hearing, motor or cognitive) and/or use assistive technologies.

Read the Service Manual guidance on:

- [making your service accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction)
- [recruiting participants](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants)

## Briefing and moderation

### Set the scene

You should set the scene by beginning with a task of using a government service that needs GOV.UK Verify. This means the test most accurately reflects real life, where the participant does not anticipate going through identity verification.

GDS are able to provide a basic prototype of a government service plus a hub; please contact the IDP assurance team when you require this.

### Make the research realistic

It is important to test all aspects of your service that users will encounter in the real world, even if they are not easy to simulate.

You should:

* use the same validation rules as your live service
* use real or realistic data about the participant
* not miss out any steps the service requires, like sending a text to a participant’s phone
* not skip steps users will have to do in the real world, like downloading an app or finding a text message
* test all the methods your service uses to identify users, even if they are difficult to simulate
* use real or realistic criteria for reaching the relevant LOA

Do your research with a realistic version of your service, in a scenario that is realistic for the participant. This adds validity to your research outcomes. It is good practice to regularly test your live service with participants. This way you can identify where you need to make improvements.

### Do not give help

Participants should not be given help during the test. When it becomes necessary to help a participant to progress through the test, this must be noted as a point where the journey presents difficulties for users.

### No opinions

Avoid basing your research assessment on any opinions stated by the participants. What matters is whether the participant can complete the required steps, and understands enough about what is happening to be able to continue.

As a general rule, what a user does is much more important than what a user says.

## Research outcomes

You should choose an appropriate method to analyse your research, for example [affinity sorting](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/analyse-a-research-session), to identify your insights and prioritise the improvements you should make.

Read about:

* [how we do research analysis in agile](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/06/05/how-we-do-research-analysis-in-agile/)
* [tips for interpreting user research](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/29/dont-jump-my-tips-for-interpreting-user-research/)

Where possible, combine your user research with analytics to find out how to improve the journey for users and the performance of the service.

Read about [using research and data to improve a live service](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/2014/09/17/6-case-studies-using-research-and-data-to-improve-a-live-service/).

Proposed solutions or changes to the service should undergo usability testing to see if they do actually solve the problem.
