# GOV.UK Verify branding rules

These rules cover the use of the GOV.UK Verify brand and logos by certified companies and non-government services. This includes but is not limited to:

* email notifications or confirmations
* web pages
* service pages, registration, authentication and confirmation pages
* TV, print, radio, outdoor, email or online advertising social media

## The GOV.UK Verify logo
Non-government services must not use the GOV.UK Verify logo.

## The certified company badge
Certified companies may use the badge in two ways:

* when users are being verified for a government service
* to show certification

The badge must be present at every stage of any verification user journey that is the result of a request from on the Verify Identity Assurance Hub.

Non-government services can only use the badge to show that an individual identity provider available on their service is a certified company in the Verify federation.

Certified companies and services may not use the badge to promote any service not covered by the terms of the framework agreement.

### Treatment

Certified companies should use the badge alongside their own company logo.

They must prioritise their own brand over the badge in the design hierarchy.

This hierarchy should be implemented via sizing or relative positioning.

The minimum size of the symbol is 140px wide for digital applications and 30mm wide for print.

The certified company badge must not be used as any kind of link or button.

## The ‘Sign in with Verify’ mark

Non-government services may use the ‘Sign in with Verify’ mark if the full federation of certified companies is available on their service.

### Treatment

The minimum size of the symbol is 118px (width) x 37px (height) for digital applications and 41.5mm (width) x 13mm (height) for print.

**Background contrast**

The mark should always appear on a white background or background colour with a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

**Clear space**

The symbol should always have appropriate clear space, illustrated here by the height of the tick in the shield.

### ‘Sign in with Verify’ button

Non-government services may adapt the ‘Sign in with Verify’ mark into a button. This should indicate the point at which users can choose to prove their identity with Verify.

![The blue sign in with Verify button](/images/sign_in_with_verify_button-01.svg)

If used, the button must consist of the ‘tick’ icon followed immediately by the phrase ‘Sign in with Verify’.

The button must have equal prominence with other third party sign-in options.

We recommend using the button as shown, but you may adapt the size of the button and the background colour. The following restrictions apply:

* the minimum height for ‘in button’ text is 19px
* the minimum height for the accompanying Verify logo is 44px
* the colour contrast ratio for the ‘Sign in with Verify’ text and background colour must be at least 4.5:1

You may not:

* distort the aspect ratio of the ‘tick’ icon
* remove or change the text from ‘Sign in with Verify’

## Writing Verify

The name ‘GOV.UK Verify’ should only be used with government relying parties.

Outside the logo and badge (in sentences or titles for example), the name is written GOV.UK Verify. ‘GOV.UK’ is written in capitals, ‘Verify’ is written with a capital ‘V’ and lowercase ‘erify’.

Non-government relying parties may use the term ‘Verify’.

## Writing about Verify

You should use any of the following when describing a certified company's relationship to Verify:

* [Company name] is a GOV.UK Verify certified company
* verify your identity with [company name] to use services on GOV.UK
* verify your identity with [company name] to use government services
* verify your identity with [company name] to use [non-government service]

Do not use:

* GOV.UK Verify by [company name]
* GOV.UK Verify from [company name]

## Referring to government services

References to government services must use the correct service name, with the correct capitalisation. Check GOV.UK for [an up-to-date list of services that use Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify#government-services).

## Writing the URL
Always lowercase. Always ‘www’ never ‘http’
