# Research and interface guidance

[Our recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZpspXBUwiwRSDVJmxwVKuWF8jsEZuJR4yTI5pCY9B8/edit#heading=h.70z2py8xf2x) for GOV.UK Verify-specific user research, design and content, accessibility and assisted digital. You should also follow the guidance in the government [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

When you’re researching and designing content for GOV.UK Verify, follow the guidance in the government [Service Manual](LINK). It helps teams create and run digital services that meet the [Government Service Standard](LINK). All public-facing transactional services must meet this standard. It’s used by departments and the Government Digital Service to check whether a service is good enough for public use.

These are our recommendations for GOV.UK Verify-specific:

- [user research](LINK)
- [design and content](LINK)
- [accessibility and assisted digital](LINK)

## User research

The [Service Manual guidance on user research](LINK) has best practice advice on how to:

- plan research
- prepare for sessions
- share and analyse findings

These are our other recommendations for GOV.UK Verify-specific research.

### General

If your organisation doesn’t have an in-house user research team or staff, work with a specialist user research agency to do research and testing. This should help to avoid delays that can happen if you haven’t done enough - or the right - research.

Read about [how to get the best out of research agencies](LINK).

If you do have in-house user research experts, explain how their research is being integrated into the work of the rest of the team - you should do this as part of your research reports (as referenced in the Service Delivery Requirements at B.14.5).

Read [5 ways to help user research work better in agile](LINK).

### Methodology

For each round of research you do, choose a research methodology suitable for the change you want to test, such as [usability testing or AB testing.](LINK)

Consider what’s appropriate for the type and size of the change you’re making. Are you changing a button label? Adding a new sentence? Changing the flow of the journey? Use the list of user research methods in the Service Manual to help decide on the best approach.

### Representative participants

#### Familiarity with the service

Research participants should not be familiar with the service. This is because most users of GOV.UK Verify won’t have used it before. Testing with these participants will help you learn the most about real users’ behaviour.

The only exception is if you are testing re­use and signing into an existing account. Here it may be appropriate to have participants who have used the system before, but only to the extent that a real user would have.

#### Digital confidence

Participants should have a realistic range of digital confidence. Everyone in the UK needs to be able to use government services. Many of them choose not to use the internet heavily in the rest of their lives. Testing with these participants will help you learn how these people understand and use your service.

One third of participants should have low digital confidence. ‘Digital confidence’ can be best determined by asking potential participants what kinds of tasks they use the internet for (not by asking them to describe their confidence level). Tasks like online banking, booking travel and shopping indicate medium or high digital confidence. Use of social media alone does not indicate medium or high digital confidence.

Read about:

- [including users with low digital skills in user research](LINK)
- [how we recruited people with low/no digital skills on Carer’s Allowance](LINK)

#### Range of devices and browsers

Do research with a range of devices and software that reflects the range that will be used to access your service. Not only will this allow your participants to test your service using technology that will be familiar to them, but it will also help expose any device or browser related issues with the service.

This should include:

- mobiles and tablets (both iOS and Android)
- computers (Windows and macOS)
- a variety of browsers (such as Chrome, Safari and Firefox)

Read the Service Manual guidance on [designing for different browsers and devices](LINK).

#### Users with disabilities

When doing research, include users who have disabilities (visual, hearing, motor or cognitive) and/or use assistive technologies.

Read the Service Manual guidance on:

- [making your service accessible](LINK)
- [recruiting participants](LINK)

### Briefing and moderation

### Set the scene

You should set the scene by beginning with a task of using a government service that needs GOV.UK Verify. This means the test most accurately reflects real life, where the participant does not anticipate going through identity verification.

GDS are able to provide a basic prototype of a government service plus a hub; please contact IDP_assurance when you require this.

#### Make the research realistic

It’s important to test all aspects of your service that users will encounter in the real world, even if they aren’t easy to simulate.

- Use the same validation rules as your live service
- Use real or realistic data about the participant
- Don’t miss out any steps the service requires, like sending a text to a participant’s phone
- Don’t skip steps users will have to do in the real world, like downloading an app or finding a text message
- Test all the methods your service uses to identify users, even if they are difficult to simulate
- Use real or realistic criteria for reaching the relevant LOA

Do your research with a realistic version of your service, in a scenario that's realistic for the participant. This adds validity to your research outcomes. It’s good practice to regularly test your live service with participants. This way you can identify where your need to make improvements.

#### Don’t give help

Participants should not be given help during the test. When it becomes necessary to help a participant to progress through the test, this must be noted as a point where the journey presents difficulties for users.

#### No opinions

Avoid basing your research assessment on any opinions stated by the participants. What matters is whether the participant can complete the required steps, and understands enough about what is happening to be able to continue.

As a general rule, what a user does is much more important than what a user says.

Read more about [what makes a good user research facilitator](LINK).

### Research outcomes

You should choose an appropriate method to analyse your research, for example [affinity sorting](LINK), to identify your insights and prioritise the improvements you should make.

Read about:
- [how we do research analysis in agile](LINK)
- [tips for interpreting user research](LINK)

Where possible, combine your user research with analytics to find out how to improve the journey for users and the performance of the service.

Read about [using research and data to improve a live service](LINK).

Proposed solutions or changes to the service should undergo usability testing to see if they do actually solve the problem.

## Design and content

The [Service Manual guidance on design](LINK) has best practice advice on how to:

- name, structure and scope your service
- prototype
- use design patterns

GOV.UK also has [guidance on planning, writing and managing content](LINK).

These are our other recommendations for GOV.UK Verify-specific design and content.

### Check research on existing patterns

Identity providers, service teams and the GOV.UK Verify programme have already done a lot of research into possible designs. Check the [design patterns](LINK) we’ve identified so far.

The patterns are based on findings from user research conducted by GDS, and relate to identity verification for government services. Identity providers may customise the patterns with their own design and branding.

- Document picker
- Faster payments
- LOA1 failure
- LOA1 success
- Method choice
- Update personal details
- Uplift failure
- Uplift message
- Uplift success

Each pattern contains:

- a summary of research findings
- a screenshot of how the patterns might look
- the raw content

### Content best practice

####  Use clear, consistent language

Use plain English, and be concise but polite. You can use an app like [Hemingway](LINK) to check readability.

Use the same words as your users to minimise cognitive load and make it easier for them to provide the correct information.

Use sentence case instead of title case or all caps. It’s easier for users to process. This includes headings, subheadings, buttons and form labels.

Use language users can trust. Poor spelling and grammar (along with inconsistent capitalisation) is often associated with phishing sites. You should:

- check any translations to avoid awkward or confusing constructions.
- use proper punctuation (no double !, no space before ?)
- make sure your tone or word choice isn’t too informal - users may not feel they can trust you with their information.

Forms are like a conversation between the service and the user. If it’s the:

- service ‘speaking’, the user is ‘you’ or ‘your’ and the service is ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and so on
- user ‘speaking’, use ‘I’, ‘me’ or ‘my’

This applies to all microcopy, including headings, input labels and link text.

#### Vocabulary

Using consistent vocabulary across the hub and identity provider journeys will help maintain user trust and confidence.

##### GOV.UK Verify

See "Writing Verify" in the branding rules.
**Don't use:** identity assurance, hub, GOV.UK

##### government service

The word 'government' must always be in lowercase (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#government).
See "Referring to government services" in the branding rules.
**Don't use:** relying party, service provider, RP, SP, transaction, GOV.UK websites, GOV.UK services, Verify services.

##### identity test

The process of testing a user’s knowledge about the claimed identity to verify that they are who they claim to be.
This language performs well in research and helps users understand why they'll be asked intrusive questions.
**Don't use:** KBVs, knowledge based verification questions

##### security code

A code that is sent to a user as part of the 2 stage authentication process when accessing the service. Stage 1: username and password. Stage 2: security code.
**Don't use:** two-factor authentication, 2 step verification, one time code, OTC, confirmation code

##### sign in

The name for the process of using identity assurance to access digital transactions on GOV.UK.
It's plainer than log in and users who understand log in would understand sign in too, while the converse might not be the case.
**Don't use:** log in, log on

##### UK photocard driving licence

Issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), UK photocard driving licences can serve as proof of identity in non-driving contexts.
Users will try to use paper driving licences, paper counterparts or driving licences issued in other countries if we aren't specific about which document they must use.
**Don't use:** driving licence

##### verified your identity / your identity has been verified

This is different to opening an account or registering - users want to verify their identity so they can access the government service they originally set out to do.
Users that fail to verify their identity have still opened an account and registered with an IDP.
**Don't use:** ‘Congratulations! You've opened your account’, or ‘Registration complete’

#### Explain how you’re using information

Explain why you are asking for each piece of information and how you will use it - at the point at which you are asking for it. If all identity providers do this, we’ll be able to remove explanations from the hub, reducing the number of screens before identity provider selection.

Explain that bank details will be used to check name and address only, and will not be used for taking payments. In research we find that even when this information is given in the hub, users do not remember and often stall when asked for bank account details. Many say that they would give up at this point, as it seems suspicious.

If users need to set a password for their identity account, but not for signing in to the service, be clear about how and when they will need the password. Telling users they won’t need passwords to access services, then asking them to set up a password (for their identity account) is confusing. In research, users don’t often distinguish between the processes at setup.

If you’re using data from someone’s credit history, reassure them that their credit rating won’t be affected by the process.

Read the GOV.UK guidance on [form structure](LINK) and [question pages](LINK).

#### Only ask for what you need

You shouldn’t ask users for their title. It’s extra work for users and you’re forcing them to potentially reveal their gender and marital status, which they may not want to do.

Only ask for a user’s gender or sex if you will use this for identity verification.

A user’s gender or sex on official documents may be different from how they identify in their day-to-day life. If you are using gender or sex for verification, consider asking: “Please give your gender as it appears on your [passport]”
(or wherever it will be checked)

Making it clear how this will be checked will help users give the appropriate answer. It will also help them understand why other options aren’t available.

As with any personal data, if it won’t be used for identity verification, don’t ask for it. If it’s checked against passport or driving license records, but the user does not have either of these, there is no need to ask. It’s best to ask when verifying that document rather than on a general details page.

If the user chooses not to give their gender or sex, make sure the alternative is not dehumanising. Consider “I prefer not to say” instead of “not specified”.

- [The Question Protocol: How to Make Sure Every Form Field Is Necessary](LINK)
- [Design for Real Life. Eric Mayer & Sara Wachter-Boettcher (2016)](LINK)

#### Write clear error messages

Error messages should be explicit, human-readable, polite and precise. They should offer constructive advice on how to fix the problem. Users don’t need to see error codes or types.

You’ll probably need to create multiple error messages per field, so they’re as specific to the problem as possible. Focus on telling the user how to fix the problem rather than describing what’s gone wrong.

Read:

- [NNG: Error Message Guidelines](LINK)
- [A List Apart: Creating Content for Sensitive Situations](LINK)

#### Don’t waste users’ time

Avoid duplicating instructions or information on the same page.

Give users an idea of what to expect next. For example, if a marriage certificate can only be used if it’s from a specific date range, let the user know before they choose this ID type. If they spend time digging out their marriage certificate only to find on the next screen that they can’t use it, this will be frustrating.

#### Make journeys consistent

Check that any guidance you link to is up to date and consistent with your current user journey.

If using an app as part of your verification process, make sure the name in the app store/on the phone matches the name you use to refer to it in the web journey. Avoid unnecessary naming or branding of features or apps. If you need to, make sure names help users understand what the app or feature does.

Read:

- [GOV.UK Service Manual: naming your service](LINK)
- [B2B founders: Stop naming stuff](LINK)

If you’re using an email address as a username, then only ask for an email address at signin. You don’t need to use the word “username” at all. It may confuse the user or make them think they have a separate username that they have forgotten.

### Content accessibility

Using an image to show text takes away the accessibility for blind and visually impaired users who use screen readers. It also makes the text a lot harder to read for anyone using a small screen.

In some cases, the images may not load. This could be due to poor internet connection, overzealous ad blockers, or user settings.

Text in images can’t be automatically translated in the browser, and users can’t copy and paste it into a translation service.

Placeholder text within a form field makes it difficult for people to remember what information belongs in a field, and to check for and fix errors. It also poses additional burdens for users with visual and cognitive impairments.

- [Ghost: The big problem with sharing text in images](LINK)
- [NNG: Placeholders in Form Fields Are Harmful](LINK)

### Interface design

If you find yourself having to explain how the the user interface works, that’s a sign something has gone wrong. Fix the interface so it doesn’t need explaining.

If asking users to verify an email address with a security code, there’s no need to ask them to enter it twice.

Avoid extra screens which do not add value to the user or progress the journey. Ask:

even if there is value, is an extra screen the right place for it?
does each screen have a real action?
can three screens of a tutorial be one screen with short bullet points?

Be consistent. If elements or links are common across screens or steps, keep them in the same position so users can find them.

Let users process information at their own pace. Avoid pop ups or screens that move on automatically.

If you can only use one of each “type” of documentation, make sure users know it - perhaps by grouping them together. For example, if they can’t use both a birth certificate and a passport, make this clear.

## Accessibility and assisted digital

All government services must be accessible to anyone that needs them. That means that all GOV.UK Verify identity providers must make sure their services:

- meet level AA of the most recent [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](LINK) as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used [assistive technologies](LINK) - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in [user research](LINK)

The [Service Manual guidance on accessibility and assisted digital](LINK) has best practice advice on how to help and encourage people to use your service.
This [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 ‘getting started’ guidance](LINK) also has:

- an easy to understand [overview of WCAG](LINK)
- [more details about each requirement](LINK) - including an understandable explanation of each success criteria, a pragmatic summary of what is required, example of common issues and links to further content
- the most relevant success criteria for [content](LINK), [design](LINK) and [code](LINK)
- a [checklist of questions](LINK) to help you assess if your digital product meets WCAG
