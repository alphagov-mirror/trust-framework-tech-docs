# Using the trustmark

The [TF] trustmark is used by digital identity companies who meet certain standards.

You must [be part of the trust framework](https://verify-participants-joining.herokuapp.com/join) to use the trustmark.


## How it works

Many users worry about security and privacy when a site asks them to share personal data. The [TF] trustmark shows that a digital identity provider:

* meets the standards set by a government-associated independent body
* has proved they meet the standards in an independent assessment

This helps users proceed with confidence.

The trustmark does not show people where they can use their digital identity. The identity provider or service should explain what a digital identity is and where it can be used.

### Working with the public sector

Companies must have the trustmark to do any digital identity work with the public sector. The [commercial framework](#) has more details about working with the public sector.

You can still choose to get the trustmark if you only work with the private sector.

## How to get the trustmark

1. Join the trust framework. You’ll need to show that you meet its standards through the [certification process](https://verify-participants-joining.herokuapp.com/how-certification-works).
2. If you’re successful, the [authoritative body] will write to you to confirm you’re part of the framework. Do not show the trustmark before you get the letter.
3. Follow the [rules for showing the trustmark](#rules-for-showing-the-trustmark) whenever you use it.

### When you must stop showing the trustmark

Stop using the trustmark immediately if your trust framework membership:

* has ended (‘expired’)
* has been terminated
* is currently suspended, even for a short time

You must also stop using the trustmark if you no longer meet the standards you were assessed on when you joined. You can continue using it if you do not meet any new standards that have been introduced since then.

When you stop using the trustmark, you:

* must remove it from all your online content
* must not create or share any printed materials that show it


## Rules for showing the trustmark

You can show the trustmark in any communications or marketing material you produce. This includes your website.

### Treatment

Show the trustmark symbol alongside your company’s logo. You must use the [most recent symbol published by the [authoritative body]](#).

The minimum size of the trustmark symbol is:

* 140px wide for digital applications
* 30mm wide for print

Prioritise your brand over the trustmark in the design hierarchy.

### Writing about the trustmark

Use the following text when describing a company that's part of the trust framework:

[Company name] is [UK identity standards certified].

In sentences or titles, say ‘trustmark’, not ‘trust mark’ or ‘Trustmark’.

### Showing the trustmark in services

Show the trustmark in any services that are covered by your trust framework agreements.

Do not show it in other services you run, even if you run them to the same standards. They each have to be assessed separately.

Public-facing services must:

* use [content tested with users](/components/#digital-identity-boilerplate-content) and maintained by the [authoritative body] to introduce digital identity
* show the trustmark at every stage of the verification user journey
* link to [content from the [authoritative body]](#) so users can check the trustmark

If you’re an identity provider, you can ask service providers that are not in the trust framework to show the trustmark next to your logo. They cannot use it for anything else.
