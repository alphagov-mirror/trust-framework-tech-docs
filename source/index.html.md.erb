# Guidance for identity providers

This guidance will help you comply with GOV.UK Verify standards when designing new parts of the identity verification journey.
You should also follow the guidance in the government [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). It helps teams create and run digital services that meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). All public-facing transactional services must meet this standard. Itâ€™s used by departments and the Government Digital Service to check whether a service is good enough for public use.
