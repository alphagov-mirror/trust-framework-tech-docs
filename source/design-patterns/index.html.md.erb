# Design patterns

There are 9 patterns, each in PDF form, on Google Drive.

## Claire's description

The patterns are based on findings from user research conducted by GDS, and relate to identity verification for government services. Identity providers may customise the patterns with their own design and branding.

## About these patterns, PDF
