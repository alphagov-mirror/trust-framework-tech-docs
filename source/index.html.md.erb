# Guidance for identity providers

This guidance will help you comply with GOV.UK Verify standards when you’re designing parts of the identity verification journey.

The guidance includes:

* GOV.UK Verify-specific [user research](/user-research) recommendations
* GOV.UK Verify-specific [design and content](/design-and-content) recommendations
* [accessibility and assisted digital](/accessibility) requirements for identity providers
* [design patterns](/design-patterns) based on findings from GDS research into identity verification
* [branding guidelines](/branding) for the use of the GOV.UK Verify brand and logos
* a template for the [3-monthly user research and interface report](/3-monthly-report)

You should also follow the guidance in the government [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). It helps teams create and run digital services that meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). 

All public-facing transactional services must meet this standard. It’s used by departments and the Government Digital Service to check whether a service is good enough for public use.
