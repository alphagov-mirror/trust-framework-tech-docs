# Accessibility and assisted digital

All government services must be accessible to anyone that needs them. That means that all GOV.UK Verify identity providers must make sure their services:

- meet level AA of the most recent [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag-20) as a minimum
- work on the most commonly used [assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
- include people with disabilities in [user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research)

The [Service Manual guidance on accessibility and assisted digital](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service) has best practice advice on how to help and encourage people to use your service.
This [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 ‘getting started’ guidance](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/) also has:

- an easy to understand [overview of WCAG](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/)
- [more details about each requirement](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/all.html) - including an understandable explanation of each success criteria, a pragmatic summary of what is required, example of common issues and links to further content
- the most relevant success criteria for [content](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/content.html#content-related-wcag-2-0-a-and-aa-success-criteria), [design](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/design.html#design-related-wcag-2-0-a-and-aa-success-criteria) and [code](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/code.html#code-related-wcag-2-0-a-and-aa-success-criteria)
- a [checklist of questions](https://alphagov.github.io/wcag-primer/checklist.html#checklist) to help you assess if your digital product meets WCAG
