You should also follow the guidance in the government [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual). It helps teams create and run digital services that meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard). 

All public-facing transactional services must meet this standard. Itâ€™s used by departments and the Government Digital Service to check whether a service is good enough for public use.
