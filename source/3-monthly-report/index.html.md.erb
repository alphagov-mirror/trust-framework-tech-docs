# 3-monthly user research and interface report

Identity providers are required to produce a quarterly report to [idp-assurance@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:idp-assurance@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) detailing:

* planned interface changes
* planned research activity
* changes implemented in the last 3 months
* research conducted in the last 3 months

This is the template for that report.
